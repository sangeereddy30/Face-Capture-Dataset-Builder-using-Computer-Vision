# 🖼️ Face Capture & Dataset Builder

A Python-based **face detection and image capture system** using OpenCV. This project allows users to **automatically detect faces** from a webcam, capture multiple images, and save them with unique filenames. It is ideal for building datasets for **machine learning and face recognition models**.

## 🎯 Features
✅ **Real-Time Face Detection** using OpenCV  
✅ **Automatic Face Capture** with keyboard controls  
✅ **Multiple Image Capture** per user (`name_1.jpg`, `name_2.jpg`, etc.)  
✅ **Continuous User Input** (no need to restart after each capture)  
✅ **Keyboard Shortcuts:**  
   - `C` → Capture and Save Image  
   - `ESC` → Exit the Program  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍  
- **OpenCV** (Computer Vision Library)  
- **Image Processing** (Grayscale conversion & Haar Cascade Classifier)
